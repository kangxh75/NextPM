# Engineering

Welcome to the Engineering section of NextPM, where we document the complete journey of building this AI-native PM knowledge hub.

## What You'll Find Here

This section showcases the intersection of product management and software development, demonstrating how AI tools enhance both disciplines when building in public.

### PM Workflows

Product specifications and feature planning documents. Each entry links PM thinking with actual implementation, providing:

- **Feature Specs** - Complete product requirements and design decisions
- **Implementation Timeline** - When features were started and completed
- **Related Changes** - Links to actual code commits
- **Lessons Learned** - Real insights from building with AI assistance

[Explore PM Workflows →](pm-workflows/index.md)

### Dev Workflows

Development commit summaries documenting each code change. These entries show:

- **What Changed** - Files modified and features added
- **Why Changed** - Key decisions and rationale
- **How Built** - Technical details and AI assistance used
- **Related Specs** - Links back to PM planning documents

## The NextPM Approach

### Building in Public

We document both the "what we plan" (PM Workflows) and "what we built" (Dev Workflows), creating a complete narrative of the development process.

### AI-Augmented Development

Every spec and commit summary includes details about AI tool usage, demonstrating real-world AI-augmented product development workflows.

### Complete Traceability

Bidirectional links connect specs to commits, making it easy to:

- See all commits implementing a specific feature
- Trace any code change back to its originating spec
- Understand the evolution of features over time

## Why This Matters

### For Product Managers

- **Learn by Example** - See how specs translate to actual implementation
- **Understand Dev** - Bridge the PM/Dev gap with detailed commit summaries
- **AI Workflows** - Discover how AI tools accelerate product work

### For Developers

- **Context-Rich History** - Every commit links back to business context
- **Decision Trail** - Understand why code was written a certain way
- **AI Tools** - See how tools like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot help

### For Everyone

- **Transparency** - Complete visibility into how NextPM itself is built
- **Case Studies** - Real examples of AI-native development
- **Best Practices** - Patterns and approaches you can adapt
