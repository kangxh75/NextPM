# Specifications

This section contains the complete PM specifications for NextPM features. These are the single source of truth for all feature planning and requirements.

## About These Specs

- **Source**: Files are automatically published from `project/specs/` directory
- **Format**: Each spec follows the NextPM specification template
- **Workflow**: PMs work directly on these files - no manual copying required
- **Navigation**: This page and navigation are auto-generated during build

## Spec Naming Convention

- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-nn-descriptive-name.md`
- **Example**: `2026-02-09-01-engineering-history-tracking.md`
- **Exception**: `0.00-project-start.md` (grandfathered first spec)

## Legacy Migration

The [PM Workflows (Legacy)](../pm-workflows/index.md) section contains manually created summaries from before the automated publishing system. These will remain for reference during the transition period.

For development implementation summaries, see [Dev Workflows](../dev-workflows/index.md).
