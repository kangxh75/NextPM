# 2026-02-09-01: Engineering History Tracking

**Status:** 🚧 In Progress
**Full Spec:** [View on GitHub](https://github.com/kangxh75/NextPM/blob/master/project/specs/2026-02-09-01-engineering-history-tracking.md)

## What This Feature Does

Creates a comprehensive system for tracking NextPM's development history by linking PM specifications with code commits. Reorganizes navigation under "Engineering" and provides templates for consistent documentation of both planning (PM Workflows) and implementation (Dev Workflows).

## Why It Matters

Demonstrates "building in public" by making the entire development process visible. Shows how specs translate to code, provides complete traceability from idea to deployment, and creates teaching material as a byproduct of regular development work.
