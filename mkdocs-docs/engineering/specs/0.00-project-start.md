**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Date:** 2025-01-31 to 2026-02-04
**Version:** 0.1.0 - Foundation Phase

## Overview

NextPM is an AI-native knowledge hub designed to help Product Managers 10x their productivity using AI tools. This spec documents the initial project setup, architecture decisions, and implementation of the foundational infrastructure.

## Problem

**For PMs:**
- AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor) are powerful but lack structured guidance for PM-specific workflows
- No centralized resource for prompt templates and best practices for PM work
- PMs struggle to "speak dev" and prototype ideas without extensive coding knowledge
- Scattered knowledge about AI-augmented PM practices

**For AI Assistants:**
- Most repositories lack sufficient context for effective collaboration
- Inconsistent conventions lead to friction and rework
- No clear documentation of project goals, architecture, or patterns
- Context is repeatedly explained rather than documented once

## User Impact

**Primary Users:**
- Mid-senior PMs exploring AI-augmented workflows
- Non-technical PMs wanting to prototype and understand development
- AI-curious product teams looking for actionable guidance

**Secondary Users:**
- AI assistants working on the codebase (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor)
- Future contributors and collaborators

**User Benefits:**
- Reusable prompt templates for common PM tasks (specs, research, evaluation)
- Dual documentation from both PM and dev perspectives
- Real case studies with measurable outcomes
- Living example of AI-native practices in action

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Static Knowledge Hub (Current)

Build a foundational MkDocs Material site with:

1. **AI-Native Repository Structure**
   - Rich context documentation in `/ai-context/`
   - Dual documentation philosophy (PM + Dev views)
   - Prompts as first-class artifacts in `/prompts/`
   - Specifications drive development in `/project/specs/`
   - Decision documentation in `/meta/adr/`

2. **Content Architecture**
   - PM Workflows documentation
   - Dev Workflows for PMs
   - Prompt library with reusable templates
   - Real examples and case studies
   - Teaching materials in `/examples/`

3. **Development Infrastructure**
   - MkDocs Material for static site generation
   - Python virtual environment for dependency management
   - Git version control with conventional commits
   - Clear folder structure with purpose separation
   - VS Code workspace configuration

4. **Key Differentiators**
   - **AI-first design**: Every aspect optimized for human-AI collaboration
   - **Dual perspective**: PM view + Dev view in same project
   - **Living example**: Project demonstrates its own principles
   - **Template-driven**: Reusable prompts, not just advice

## Success Metrics

### Completion Criteria (Phase 1)
- [x] AI-native repository structure created

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions

**Tech Stack:**
- **Static Site Generator**: MkDocs Material (chosen for PM-friendly markdown)
- **Language**: Python 3.12+ (MkDocs ecosystem)
- **Hosting**: Azure Static Web Apps (author has MSDN subscription)
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits

**Folder Structure:**
```
NextPM/
├── mkdocs-docs/       # MkDocs content (renamed from docs/)
├── mkdocs-static/     # Static assets (renamed from static/)
├── mkdocs-site/       # Build output (renamed from site/)
├── project/           # NextPM's development artifacts (NEW)
│   ├── specs/         # Feature specifications
│   ├── tasks/         # Task breakdowns
│   └── validations/   # Validation documentation
├── meta/              # Architecture decisions & retrospectives
├── examples/          # Teaching materials for users
├── prompts/           # Prompt library (PM & Dev)
├── ai-context/        # Context for AI assistants
├── scripts/           # Automation scripts
└── venv/              # Python virtual environment
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **MkDocs Folder Prefix Strategy**
   - Prefixed all MkDocs folders with `mkdocs-` for clarity
   - Keeps root folder clean and identifiable
   - Documented in `/ai-context/conventions.md`

2. **Dual Folder Strategy**
   - `/project/` - NextPM's own development work
   - `/examples/` - Sanitized teaching materials for users
   - Separates working artifacts from published examples

3. **AI Context First**
   - Created comprehensive AI context before writing code
   - Enables productive AI collaboration from day one
   - Documents conventions, architecture, and goals upfront

4. **Spec-Driven Development**
   - Every feature starts with a specification
   - This document itself follows that pattern
   - Creates alignment before implementation

### Dependencies

**Python Packages** (requirements.txt):
- `mkdocs>=1.5.0` - Static site generator
- `mkdocs-material>=9.5.0` - Material theme
- `pymdown-extensions>=10.7` - Enhanced markdown

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Scope creep | High | Strict phase-based approach, defer Phase 2 features |
| Insufficient PM content | High | Author is PM, can create authentic content |
| Over-engineering | Medium | Keep Phase 1 simple, iterate based on usage |
| AI context becomes stale | Medium | Regular updates documented in commits |
| Technical complexity for PM | Medium | Dual documentation, heavy commenting |

### Technical Constraints

- **No database** in Phase 1 (static site only)
- **No authentication** until Phase 2
- **No dynamic features** until backend added
- **Windows-first** development (author's environment)
- **Solo developer** (learning project)

## Out of Scope

**For Phase 1:**
- ❌ Dynamic/interactive features
- ❌ User authentication
- ❌ Backend APIs
- ❌ Database integration
- ❌ Usage analytics (beyond basic Google Analytics)
- ❌ Community contributions (until GitHub public)
- ❌ Search functionality beyond MkDocs default
- ❌ Multiple language support
- ❌ Mobile app

**Explicitly Deferred to Phase 2:**
- Interactive PM tools
- User accounts and profiles
- Tool usage tracking
- Cosmos DB integration
- FastAPI + HTMX backend

## Lessons Learned

**What Went Well:**
- ✅ AI-native structure enabled productive collaboration with AI assistants
- ✅ Comprehensive upfront documentation saved explanation time
- ✅ Folder renaming strategy (mkdocs- prefix) improved clarity
- ✅ Dual folder strategy (/project/ vs /examples/) clarified purpose
- ✅ Spec-first approach created clear alignment

**What Could Be Better:**
- ⚠️ Could have created project/ folder structure earlier
- ⚠️ Initial git commit could have included more context in message
- ⚠️ Should document decisions as ADRs during implementation, not after

**AI Assistance Effectiveness:**
- 🤖 Claude Code was highly effective for structure creation
- 🤖 Having AI context documentation made subsequent AI interactions faster
- 🤖 Clear conventions reduced back-and-forth
- 🤖 Estimated time saved: 60-70% vs traditional setup

## Sign-off
