# Development Implementation Summaries

This section contains automatically generated summaries of development work linked to NextPM specifications.

## About These Summaries

- **Auto-generated**: Created automatically from git commit data
- **Spec-linked**: Each summary corresponds to a specific PM specification
- **Real-time**: Updated whenever specs are rebuilt with new commits
- **Traceability**: Shows complete development timeline from spec to implementation

## How It Works

1. **Spec Creation**: PM writes specification with unique ID (e.g., `2026-02-13-01`)
2. **Development**: Developers commit code with spec reference: `git commit -m "feat: implement feature (#2026-02-13-01)"`
3. **Auto-tracking**: Build system detects commits and generates implementation summaries
4. **Bidirectional Linking**: Summaries link back to specs, specs show commit timelines

## Current Implementation Summaries

The summaries below are automatically generated based on git commit history:

- **[2026-02-09-01](2026_02_09_01_implementation_summary.md)**: Engineering History Tracking System
- **[2026-02-10-01](2026_02_10_01_implementation_summary.md)**: Site Authentication
- **[2026-02-13-01](2026_02_13_01_implementation_summary.md)**: NextPM Spec-Driven Development Showcase

## Benefits for PMs

- **Complete Visibility**: See exactly what code was changed for each spec
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor development progress in real-time
- **Decision History**: Understand implementation decisions and trade-offs
- **AI-Assisted**: Automatic generation means no manual tracking required
