# 0.00: Project Start

**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Full Spec:** [View on GitHub](https://github.com/kangxh75/NextPM/blob/master/project/specs/0.00-project-start.md)

## What This Feature Does

Establishes the foundation for NextPM as an AI-native PM knowledge hub. Sets up the core infrastructure including MkDocs Material site, folder structure, CI/CD pipeline, and Azure Static Web Apps hosting.

## Why It Matters

Creates a clean, organized foundation for building NextPM with clear separation of concerns (working files vs teaching materials), proper tooling, and automated deployment. This foundation ensures the project can scale and evolve efficiently.

## Implementation Timeline

- **Started:** 2026-02-04
- **Completed:** 2026-02-07

- [2026-02-07 Placeholder Pages](../dev-workflows/2026-02-07-placeholder-pages.md)

## Key Outcomes

- Clean root folder with mkdocs- prefix for tool-specific folders
- Two-folder strategy: /project/ for working artifacts, /examples/ for teaching materials
- Full CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions deploying to Azure Static Web Apps
- Site successfully deployed to www.kangxh.com
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key choices

## Lessons Learned

**Folder Organization:** Prefixing tool-specific folders (mkdocs-) keeps the root clean and intentions clear. This pattern scales well as the project grows.

**Strict Mode Benefits:** Maintaining MkDocs `--strict` flag with placeholder pages catches broken links early, ensuring quality from day one.

**Two-Folder Clarity:** Separating /project/ (working) from /examples/ (teaching) prevents confusion and makes it clear which content is published vs internal.
