**Next-generation Product Management with AI**

## What is NextPM?

NextPM is your practical guide to **10x your PM productivity** using AI tools. Whether you're curious about Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot, you'll find real workflows, reusable prompts, and honest case studies here.

!!! tip "AI-Native Repository"
    This project is built using the AI-augmented workflows it documents. It's a living example of PM-AI collaboration. See [AI-Native approach](about/ai-native.md).

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

### [PM Workflows](engineering/pm-workflows/index.md)
Step-by-step guides for common PM tasks with AI:

- **[Spec Writing](engineering/pm-workflows/spec-writing.md)** - Write PRDs, user stories, and one-pagers faster
- **User Research** - Synthesize interviews and feedback with AI
- **Feature Evaluation** - Score and prioritize with AI assistance
- **Prototyping** - Create working demos without dev resources

### [Prompt Library](prompts/index.md)
Copy-paste templates for your PM work:

- PRD templates
- User story generators
- Research synthesis prompts
- Evaluation frameworks
- And more...

### [Examples & Case Studies](examples/case-studies.md)
Real examples with measurable outcomes:

- Before/after comparisons
- Time saved (hours → minutes)
- Quality improvements
- Honest lessons learned

### [Dev Workflows for PMs](engineering/dev-workflows/index.md)
Learn enough dev to be dangerous:

- Using Cursor without coding experience
- GitHub Copilot for non-developers
- Reading and understanding code
- Building simple prototypes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Explore a Workflow

Start with [Spec Writing with AI](engineering/pm-workflows/spec-writing.md) - it's the most impactful for most PMs.

### 2. Try a Prompt

Copy a template from the [Prompt Library](prompts/index.md) and use it in Claude or ChatGPT.

### 3. Share Your Results

Did it work? How much time did you save? Let me know!

## 👥 Who Is This For?

- **Mid-Senior PMs** wanting to leverage AI in daily work
- **Non-technical PMs** curious about prototyping
- **Product Leaders** evaluating AI tools for their teams
- **AI-curious PMs** looking for practical guidance

!!! note "No Coding Required"
    Most content assumes zero coding knowledge. Dev-focused content is clearly marked.

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

### Practical Over Theoretical
Every guide includes real examples and actual prompts. No hand-waving.

### Honest About Limitations
AI isn't magic. I'll tell you when traditional methods work better.

### Learning in Public
This is my journey learning AI-augmented PM work. Mistakes included.

### Community-Oriented
All content is free and open. Remix, share, and build on it.

## 📊 What Results Can You Expect?

Based on my own experience:

| Task | Traditional Time | With AI | Time Saved |
|------|------------------|---------|------------|
| PRD (5-page) | 6-8 hours | 2-3 hours | **60%** |
| User Stories (10) | 2 hours | 30 minutes | **75%** |
| Research Synthesis | 4 hours | 1.5 hours | **60%** |
| Competitive Analysis | 3 hours | 1 hour | **65%** |

!!! warning "Your Mileage May Vary"
    These are my results. Your outcomes depend on your context, tool proficiency, and task complexity.
